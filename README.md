# A Keycloak Admin API client

This project comes to implement some implemented API calls not implemented in the official Keycloak Admin library for JavaScript.

This lib is intended to be lightweight, fast, and productive for the developer.

This is the very first release and it's still being tested, **it's a non production release at this moment**.

Please provide feedback.
