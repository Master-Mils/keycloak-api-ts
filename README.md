## Introduction

**Keycloak API TS** is a TypeScript client library for the Keycloak Admin API. This library aims to provide support for API calls not yet implemented by the official [keycloak-admin-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keycloak/keycloak-admin-client). Our goal is to offer a lightweight, fast, and developer-friendly experience.

## Features

- Implements additional Keycloak Admin API methods.
- Lightweight and efficient.
- Written in TypeScript for robust type-checking and improved developer experience.
- Easy to extend and contribute to.

## Installation

To install the library, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install keycloak-api-ts
```

or

```bash
yarn add keycloak-api-ts
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the library:

```typescript
import KeycloakAdmin from 'keycloak-api-ts';

const keycloakAdmin = new KeycloakAdmin({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/auth',
  realmName: 'your-realm',
  clientId: 'your-client-id',
  clientSecret: 'your-client-secret',
});

// Example usage
(async () => {
  const users = await keycloakAdmin.getUsers();
  console.log(users);
})();
```
